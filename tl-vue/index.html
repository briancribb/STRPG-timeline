					<h3>How Stardates Work</h3>
					<p class="lead">[century]/[year][month].[day]</p>
					<p>To make things easier for real-life readers, stardates were set up to be just another way to write a regular date. The first number in a stardate is the century, which is based upon the year 2000. A value of "-2" would mean "1800", or the 19th century. Next there's a two-digit year followed by a two-digit month. Lastly, the day is placed after a decimal point.</p>
					<p>Example: <strong>-3/2307.15</strong> is the same as <strong>July 15th, 1723</strong>. That's three centuries before the year 2000, "23" is the year, "07" is the month and "15" is the day.</p>
					<p>Since this is just a format change, there's no consideration for zero. The month still starts with "1" as the first day. If you see a trailing zero, it indicates that the day or month was omitted from the original entry. A stardate of <strong>-5/22</strong> would be seen here as <strong>-5/2200.00</strong> for sorting purposes.</p>
