# STRPG-timeline
This was going to be another AngularJS experiment, but then I realized that it wasn't complex enough for that.

Through OCR scanning and a bit of typing, I've put together a collection of all of the timelines from the old FASA Star Trek Role-Playing Game. I thought it would be fun to have them all organized in a simple web app. The layout is mostly pulled from here: *http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/timeline-responsive*

The experimental was to pull in data from a Google spreadsheet, process it, sort it and then dump it into the browser window using a document fragment and jQuery. Target classes are added and removed to show/hide events from the various timelines.

The basic functionality is in there now, but there's more to do. It's a work-in-progress.
